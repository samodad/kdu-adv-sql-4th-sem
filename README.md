# 📘 Advanced SQL – 4th Semester

This repository contains **Advanced SQL scripts and lab tasks** developed as part of the **4th semester Advanced SQL course at KDU** (General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University). It includes practical scripts, documentation, and Power BI reports meant to demonstrate real SQL query writing and database analytics skills.

## 📂 Repository Contents

| File           | Description                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Task 03.sql`  | Advanced SQL query script for Task 03 |
| `Task 03.pbix` | Power BI report for Task 03           |
| `Task 2.sql`   | SQL script for Task 02                |
| `Task 2.pdf`   | Documentation and outputs for Task 02 |
| `Task 3.pdf`   | Documentation and outputs for Task 03 |

> The SQL files demonstrate advanced querying techniques. The Power BI file shows how to connect SQL data with visual analytics tools.


## 🚀 How to Use

### 🧠 Requirements

Before running the scripts and reports, ensure you have:

* **SQL Server / Azure SQL Database / any RDBMS** that supports T-SQL
* A SQL client (e.g., **Azure Data Studio**, **SQL Server Management Studio**)
* **Power BI Desktop** to open the `.pbix` file

### 📌 Running the SQL Scripts

1. Connect to your database using your SQL editor.
2. Open the `.sql` files from this repository.
3. Execute the queries against an appropriate test database.

Feel free to customize table names and data to match your environment.

### 📊 Opening Reports

1. Open `Task 03.pbix` in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Update the data source connection to point to your SQL database.
3. Refresh dataset to see updated visuals.

## 📘 Learning Objectives

This repository demonstrates:

* Writing **advanced SQL queries** (JOINs, nested queries, grouping, subqueries)
* Exporting and documenting SQL results (PDFs included)
* Visualizing SQL results with **Power BI**
* Combining database querying with analytics reporting

## 💡 Best Practices

* Use scripts in parts to explore each query’s impact.
* Document your result sets in PDF or Markdown.
* When using Power BI, add slicers and filters for dynamic exploration.

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to contribute enhancement ideas or additional lab tasks by submitting a pull request.

## 📝 Notes

* This repo reflects practical work for **4th semester Advanced SQL** coursework.
* SQL conventions used assume **T-SQL compatible syntax**.

## ⭐ Acknowledgements
